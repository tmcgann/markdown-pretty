Markdown Pretty
===============

A simple web app that allows users to input text as markdown and see the HTML output. Optionally, users can open output in a print view where style (font face, size, color, etc.) persists when printing. Input is saved to local storage upon generating output. When you return to the page on the same machine your last input is loaded.
